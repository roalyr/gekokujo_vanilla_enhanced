 You can draw different weapons from your weapon slots by using the scroll wheel of your mouse.\
 In the default configuration, scrolling up pulls out your next weapon, and scrolling down pulls out your shield.\

 He will try his best to knock you unconscious, while you must protect yourself with your shield\

 You can press the Tab key at any time to return to the tutorial menu."),

  ("tutorial_3_msg_1","{!}This tutorial is intended to give you an overview of parrying and defence without a shield.\
 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\
 When you are defending with a weapon, you are only protected from one direction, the direction in which your weapon is set.\
 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\
 Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you.\
 That's why, in order to survive without a shield, you must learn directional defence.\
 Go pick up the quarterstaff by pressing the F key now to begin practice."),
  ("tutorial_3_msg_2","{!}By default, the direction in which you defend (by clicking and holding your right mouse button) is determined by the attack direction of your closest opponent.\
 For example, if your opponent is readying a thrust attack, pressing and holding the right mouse button will parry thrust attacks, but not side or overhead attacks.\
 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\
 Now it's time for you to move on to the next room, where you'll have to defend yourself against an armed opponent.\
 Your task is to defend yourself successfully for twenty seconds with no equipment other than a simple quarterstaff.\
 Your quarterstaff's attacks are disabled for this tutorial, so don't worry about attacking and focus on your defence instead.\
 Move on to the next room when you are ready to initiate the fight."),

 Try to remain standing for twenty seconds. You have {reg3} seconds to go."),

 Now you will be pitted against a more challenging opponent that will make things more difficult for you.\

 In this sequence you'll learn about riding a horse and how to perform various martial exercises on horseback.\
 We'll start by getting you mounted up.\
 Approach the horse, and press the 'F' key when you see the word 'Mount'."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_2","{!}While on horseback, W, A, S, and D keys control your horse's movement, not your own.\
 Ride your horse and try to follow the yellow flag around the course.\
 When you reach the flag, it will move to the next waypoint on the course until you reach the finish."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_3","{!}Very good. Next we'll cover attacking enemies from horseback. Approach the yellow flag now."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_4","{!}Draw your sword (using the mouse wheel) and destroy the two targets.\
 Try hitting the dummies as you pass them at full gallop -- this provides an extra challenge,\
 but the additional speed added to your blow will allow you to do more damage.\
 The easiest way of doing this is by pressing and holding the left mouse button until the right moment,\
 releasing it just before you pass the target."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_5","{!}Excellent work. Now let us try some target shooting from horseback. Go near the yellow flag now."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_6","{!}Locate the archery target beside the riding course and shoot it three times with your bow.\

  ("npc18_backstory_a", "Ah, just asking, because you never know. I myself am from Mongolia. True, true, not very far from here, but I arrived in this country from the east, via New Spain. When I came of age, I did not want to live the life of a nomad pastoralist, so I ran away and journeyed the world."),

  ("npc21_backstory_a", "I'm a foreigner, as you've probably noticed. My homeland is Cebu, in what the Spanish call the Philippine Islands. I was a sailor in service of King Tupas, when my boat was waylaid by Moluccan pirates and I was enslaved. They sold me off to these barbarians from the far west of India."),
  ("npc22_backstory_a", "Yes. Wajin. As opposed to Kumaso, or Ryukyuan, or Emishi. Or Utari, like me, which you probably know as Ainu. I am also a direct descendant of Iteki Emishi lords that fled Hiraizumi after the fall of the Northern Fujiwara."),

  ("npc1_backstory_b", "For generations, my family have been hereditary retainers to a minor samurai clan. For 8 years I followed that clan into battle as a common footsoldier."),
  ("npc2_backstory_b", "I come from a family of retainers to the Saigyo clan. A while back, I took up the duties of my family, despite my young age -- my grandfather had suddenly disappeared one day. Well, after a string of mistakes on my part due to my lack of experience, the lady of the house has forced me to take a sabbatical."),
  ("npc3_backstory_b", "I was originally from England, but I came here on a Dutch ship -- it ran aground after being lost in the Pacific. There were only nine of us alive when we got here, and it was just our luck that we got picked up by Spanish priests instead of Japanese. They told the local daimyo we were pirates and we were tossed in prison! Luckily, the kind lord came to his senses, expelled the Catholics, and set me free. I went into his service as a technical advisor, helping him build a modern galleon. Unfortunately, before he could gain mastery of the sea, he was defeated on land and committed seppuku. The daimyo that defeated him had no use for a man such as myself and I've been wandering Japan ever since."),
  ("npc4_backstory_b", "Like all the men of my family, I have come north to make a name for myself in the profession of arms before returning home to take over custodianship of the school. Unfortunately, the authorities in these lands have little understanding of the warrior code, and have chosen to call me a bandit and brigand, and put a price on my head -- a most unfair libel to throw at an adventurer, you will surely agree."),
  ("npc5_backstory_b", "For as long as anyone can remember, my family has been making its living by captaining and crewing ships for merchants that traded with your country. Then out of nowhere, the emperors banned all overseas shipping. That was more than a hundred years ago, but it didn't really matter -- there was no easy way to enforce it. My family continued to do as it always did, to put food on the table. Out of nowhere, the bureaucrat that had been looking the other way from our activities turned on us and my entire family had been arrested for 'smuggling'. I was only able to escape with my life because I was crew on a ship already here."),
  ("npc6_backstory_b", "You see, I am from the kuge of the imperial court. My husband was an attendant to his majesty the reigning emperor himself. However, he set out for an 88-temple pilgrimage and never returned. I set out myself to see what happened to him."),
  ("npc7_backstory_b", "It was my bad luck to accept a duel. It was my bad luck, when I actually showed up to fight the duel, I was hours late -- my opponent's followers had brought themselves into a rage over my disrespect. It was my bad luck that I won that duel and was chased around town by those said followers, who were thirsting for my blood in vengeance."),
  ("npc8_backstory_b", "I am from an old family in Navarre, a kingdom between France and Spain in Europe. I am a missionary for the holy mother church, in the Society of Jesus -- you probably know it from its more common name, the Jesuit order. I've spent most of my life risking death to spread the word of our Lord to the world. I've been here in Japan for years now, but my progress has been glacial compared to my work in the Americas and India. I know it must be the wars between the domains and the instability making it troublesome for me, but I can't help but feel depressed."),
  ("npc9_backstory_b", "I am from a noble family in Kyoto. We weren't of very high rank, but kuge are kuge. Then my father died. Understandably, my mother remarried to secure our future. Unfortunately, her new husband was a most base and uncouth samurai, who took many concubines. Although my mother was the newest, she had the highest status. We were seen by the other women as threats. One of the older wives thought that her children's positions were undermined by my existence. She could not move against me openly, but the other day I fed a pot of food that had been left out for me to one of my dogs, and it keeled over. I accused that wife, but my stepfather refused to believe me and ordered me to leave his sight."),
  ("npc10_backstory_b", "A townsman I was, in {s19}at {s20}. Twenty years I worked as a common laborer for a merchant, taking heavy loads to other towns and taking the occasional hard knock from bandits. It was all for the sake of my family. Then one day, the province's peace was broken by these wars between the daimyo. My particular district was brought under the domain of a snot-nosed, downy-lipped samurai, barely out of his mother's cradle. He came upon me, my boss, and my coworkers walking down the road, with loads of goods on our backs. We stepped off to let him pass, but we did not bow, for we wanted to be on our way and did not want to drop our loads. He thought it was a sign of disrespect and tried to cut us all down, invoking his right of kirisute gomen. Luckily, I had a short sword hidden in my belt, to defend myself from highwaymen... My companions were not as lucky."),
  ("npc11_backstory_b", "I had a bit of a misunderstanding {s19}in {s20} about a horse that I found tied up outside the inn. It was the spitting image of a beast that threw me a few days back and ran off. Naturally I untied it for a closer look. As it turns out, the horse belonged to a merchant, a pinch-faced old goat who wouldn't accept that it all was a simple misunderstanding, and went off to get a guard."),
  ("npc12_backstory_b", "I am by training a buddhist monk, but condemned by the lords of this land to a life of a wandering hermit. My temple was sacked for supposedly training and supporting Ikko-Ikki, -- baseless accusations by the paranoid and unenlightened."),
  ("npc13_backstory_b", "I am not a samurai, just the daughter of one. But perhaps you may also have heard of my prowess as a poet, who can move the iciest warrior to despair. Or of my prowess in the art of the dance, in which I must confess a modest degree of skill. I have an affection for travel, and for the past several years have visited several towns, castles, and villages, making the most of my talents."),
  ("npc14_backstory_b", "I was the uncle of Imagawa Yoshimoto, former ruler of Suruga province and head of the long-gone Imagawa clan, of whom you have no doubt heard. Having no chance for inheritance, I was sent to a temple as a child. Unfortunately, I was called into service anyway, and did the best I could despite my training as a monk instead of a samurai. But the lord here in {s20} has no taste for the disciplinary methods needed to turn rabble into soldiers. I told him it was wiser to flog them now, then bury them later. But he would not listen, and I was told to take my services elsewhere. I can't even return to my temple."),
  ("npc15_backstory_b", "A samurai {s19}in {s20} showed me disrespect on the street, and I challenged him to a duel. He accepted, but later changed his mind. He knew I wouldn't allow him to withdraw his challenge for the sake of honor, and decided to try to ambush me in an alley. Trouble is, he is not my peer. His head had to be buried separately from his body. His lord found him valuable for some reason--maybe for tasks other than war, like pouring tea, and forced my master to release me from service if they were to remain as allies. Here I am now, a base ronin."),
  ("npc16_backstory_b", "I grew up in Kisoyu castle as a bushi, training alongside my father and brothers. I would amuse myself by hunting mice through the pantries and sculleries. I was so good at it that I put the castle cats out of a job, and eventually the lord realized that I might also be employed to fight for him directly. Needless to say, I found a number of opportunities to avail myself of the heads that had formerly belonged to my lord's enemies. Their family did not appreciate that, and sent men to provoke me into duels. I would accept them, but cut them down away from the appointed dueling grounds. It was quicker and safer, naturally. The trail of dead bodies became too much of a liability for my lord and he released me from service. I have since become a free agent and my last job was {s19}in {s20}."),
  ("npc17_backstory_b", "I tried to take my case directly to the Great King, but he became furious with me for breaking protocol--I did not rank high enough to actually meet him. But it was important, damn it!"),
  ("npc18_backstory_b", "I suppose you can take the girl out of nomadism, but you can't take nomadism out of the girl. I've been here and there, spent time in India and Europe, at least two years in the Americas, and so forth. I bet you've never even heard of that place, have you?"),
  ("npc19_backstory_b", "I reckon you were only using context cues to figure out what I meant by 'howdy', but that's good enough for me. Heck, it even seems like a good omen -- I haven't had anything positive happen since I got, uh, here."),
  ("npc20_backstory_b", "My ex-husband is Japanese. Was Japanese. He's dead now. We were trying to run down a huge merchantman, but we bit off more than we could chew."),
  ("npc21_backstory_b", "I just jumped ship recently--I'd been planning it for months, actually. I couldn't go home, where the Spanish would be looking for me, or in China, where I would be enslaved by someone else. I just didn't expect this... At least I had a small supply of meat when I left, but it already ran out..."),
  ("npc22_backstory_b", "I am here as an envoy of my tribe, which has been suffering incessant raiding by Japanese bandits recently. Unfortunately, I am not making any headway--I do not even know who to speak to. We thought that I was simply going to visit the Emperor's court in Kyoto, but he turned out to be powerless and impoverished. There does not seem to be anyone in charge of Japan at all!"),

  ("npc1_backstory_c", "It's no kind of life, as ashigaru. You're fodder for everything -- from arrows to cannonballs. If your master loses a battle, and your captors don't execute you, you're jobless and without future prospects. If you can get work as a soldier again, you have to start from scratch. I've decided to get out of the business, but war is all I know."),
  ("npc2_backstory_c", "I'm supposed to gain worldly experience in place of the mentorship my grandfather could not complete. If I don't shape up soon, I will fail not only my lady, but also my family, and the memory of my grandfather. I would have to rightfully kill myself... And who would take care of the Saigyo clan after me? Nobody!"),
  ("npc3_backstory_c", "It's quite a fascinating country, but it's too bad nobody needs me. Nobody cares about sea power, and everyone's already quite the expert on guns and cannon."),
  ("npc4_backstory_c", "But I am anxious to avoid any further trouble, so if you knew of any company of fighting men where I might enlist, I would be most grateful."),
  ("npc5_backstory_c", "I figure Japan's a good place as any to stay, to make a name for myself."),
  ("npc6_backstory_c", "I was already certain that he was dead, but I felt that I had to see the body for myself. The journey before I finally found his bones exposed me firsthand to destruction and suffering of our era. It changed me. I renounced courtly life and I am now wandering the land in search of a way to restore justice."),
  ("npc7_backstory_c", "But I do not count myself unlucky, stranger, no more than any other samurai in Japan. There's a war going on, you know."),
  ("npc8_backstory_c", "I ought to have been in China by now, beginning a mission there."),
  ("npc9_backstory_c", "I am at a loss as to what to do with myself. There's nobody in my family left in Kyoto. I am condemned to make my bed among thieves, ronin, merchants, and the other riff-raff of the road."),
  ("npc10_backstory_c", "Now I'm here getting drunk, and the oni take tomorrow."),
  ("npc11_backstory_c", "But if I was with a larger group who could vouch for me, they might let it pass. I'd be very grateful to you."),
  ("npc12_backstory_c", "The lord of this particular domain is himself a devout Buddhist and reluctant to persecute me, but I am anxious to move on elsewhere."),
  ("npc13_backstory_c", "Which reminds me -- somewhere out there in the city is a rather irate wife. I don't suppose you might consider helping me leave town?"),
  ("npc14_backstory_c", "So, if you know of any commander who believes that his purpose is to win battles, rather than pamper his soldiers, I would be pleased if you directed me to him."),
  ("npc15_backstory_c", "More fool me for having honored my foe with a coup de grace, than let him live in shame, I suppose. But the end of it all is that I'm in a difficult spot, with no master and no income."),
  ("npc16_backstory_c", "Unfortunately, my last employer's wife had a lovely paramour, and I could not resist bringing it upon myself to defend my boss's honor. She doesn't know his head is missing yet, but she will soon. My boss would probably not appreciate it anyway, since it would bring him tremendous embarassment. So tell me, are you looking for helpers?"),
  ("npc17_backstory_c", "So here I am, the only possible place I could travel to that was not China."),
  ("npc18_backstory_c", "I usually stick around for a while, doing odd jobs, taking in the local flavor and such. I just arrived in Japan, and I was actually looking for someone to follow around."),
  ("npc19_backstory_c", "Look here, pardner, I think that was a sign that we stick together. I got a good feelin'."),
  ("npc20_backstory_c", "It was a Portugese galleon, you see. Magnificent hull, but even more magnificent cannons. Mistake on our part, I suppose. We mostly got out of that alive, but our ship is no longer seaworthy."),
  ("npc21_backstory_c", "Oh man, I will do anything for meat. I'll even kill for it. You look like the type who would hire me to do that... Come on, what do you say?"),
  ("npc22_backstory_c", "Still, this trip has not been waste. I've always wanted to see the lands of my ancestors--lands I would have helped rule if things had turned out differently..."),

  ("npc1_backstory_later", "I've been around and about. But it's a rare lord who'll take on a commoner like me as a samurai, even if I could whip half the boys in his outfit."),

  ("npc3_backstory_later", "I'm an unwilling immigrant from England, but now I am also unwilling to leave."),
  ("npc4_backstory_later", "I went back to my ancestral home, to inspect the school. But we had locusts, you see, and bad rains, and other things, so here I am again, looking for work."),

  ("npc6_backstory_later", "I am wandering the land in search of a way to restore justice."),
  ("npc7_backstory_later", "I have been wandering, looking for work as a swordsman, but it has not been easy. There are just so many ronin about. They all want to duel over job openings and I'm just not up to it these days. Maybe later."),
  ("npc8_backstory_later", "I am still seeking to spread the word of God, and reduce the suffering of the people of Japan in any way I can."),
  ("npc9_backstory_later", "I have a sword, and some skill in it. I thought it would be appropriate to offer my services to a few lords in these parts, but I find as often as not they'll ask me to write poems, or play the flute, or some other job not fit for even a lowly samurai, because I am a kuge, and especially because I am a woman. {But you wouldn't know anything about that/I'm sure you know what that is like}."),
  ("npc10_backstory_later", "I don't know if I told you or not, but I struck down a young samurai who had tried to have me executed for disrespect. Since then I've been laying low. Thankfully I had the wit to pilfer his purse before heading out, but the money is running low."),
  ("npc11_backstory_later", "I've been here and about, you know, doing my best to keep out of trouble. I'm desperately in need of work, however."),
  ("npc12_backstory_later", "I have been here and about, tending to the sick and taking what I can. But the people of these parts are ignorant, and have little respect for my way of life. The few coins I make are barely enough for me to replenish my stock of medicine. I should be grateful for the chance to find other work."),
  ("npc13_backstory_later", "I have been wandering through the cities of Japan, leaving a string of love-sick men in my wake. But I grow weary of such simple challenges, and had been thinking of turning myself to more martial pastimes."),

  ("npc15_backstory_later", "I've been going from castle to castle, looking to see if anyone needs my services. But either the lord's away, or he's got other things on his mind, or I run into his samurai on the street, itching to provoke me, and I realize that here's one job not to take. So if you hear of anything, let me know."),

He's obsessive about the Bushido code, as if it were a real thing to be revered instead of just an abstract ideal formulated by a bored bureaucrat putting on airs. He was flustered after I told him this and he challenged me to a duel. I would have gladly killed him where he stood, but I knew you wouldn't like it, so I just beat him up a little to shut him up.

  ("npc6_retirement_speech", "I joined this company in the hope that you would lead Japan out of darkness, and indeed I have found a measure of peace here. But I have some qualms about your leadership, and have begun to suspect that the path to avenge my husband can be found elsewhere."),

  ("npc12_retirement_speech", "I've done all right in your company. I filled my belly, put some gold in my purse, and broadened my knowledge of wounds and injury -- I can't complain about that!

And, to tell you the truth, I've had a bit of difficulty finding work. Listen, if you'd be willing to have me back, I'd be willing to sign up with your company again."),
  ("npc2_rehire_speech", "{Sir/Madame}! It's good to see you again. But I'll confess -- I've been looking for you. I returned to my mistress, ready to serve again. But she just asked quizzically, 'Back so soon?' She wasn't sure I learned anything at all! She didn't even notice that I looked older now. So tell me, {sir/madam}, would you have me back for a while longer?"),
  ("npc3_rehire_speech", "Well, hello {sir/madame}! It is very good to see you again. I have not fared so well since we parted, I am afraid. I was able to reach the Chinese mainland, but my money ran out before I could finance passage back to Europe. China is even less welcoming than Japan, especially when everyone found out that was where I reached the country from. And perhaps I am better suited to war than to commerce, to share a meal over a campfire with rough fellows than to drink wine with the burghers of Amsterdam. {Sir/Madam}, I must ask you -- will you take me back?"),
  ("npc4_rehire_speech", "Why hello, captain. It's been a while. You've done well for yourself, I hear. For my part, I've been having some difficulties coaxing a living from my school -- locusts, bad rains, unruly students, that sort of thing. I thought I might take up the sword once more. I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I'd be honored to fight in your ranks once again."),
  ("npc5_rehire_speech", "{playername}! Your fame grows ever greater -- even as far as my homeland, beyond the seas. I'd returned there, hoping that the Emperor's men had forgotten. Well, they had not -- even before I set foot in my province, I had word from my cousins that imperial officials were looking for me. So I came back again, hoping you might forget any harsh words I had spoken, to see if I could fight with you once again."),
  ("npc6_rehire_speech", "It is good to see you, {sir/madam}. Everywhere I go, men are in awe of your deeds. I have not had it so well since I left. Wherever I go, I feel my demons returning. My soul is in turmoil. For reasons that I cannot fully explain, I had found peace in your company, even if I had questions about your leadership. Will you allow me to serve with you once again?"),
  ("npc7_rehire_speech", "Captain! It is good to see you. Forgive what I may have said when we parted. I took a ship out of Kagoshima, bound for the west, but it was taken by pirates and after my ransom I was set ashore back here. There may be better places in the world than Japan, but I have yet to see them. So I think, if it is my lot to live here, then your company is as good a livelihood as any. Will you have me back?"),
  ("npc8_rehire_speech", "Greetings to you, {playername}. I was wondering if the harsh words spoken between us in the past could be forgotten. I have been proselytizing among the Zainichi Chinese here in Japan, to see if I could do it easily. But I could not find enough men to run a mission, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off. So I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and I won as many converts as skirmishes."),
  ("npc9_rehire_speech", "My dear, dear {man/lady}! So good it is to see you! I have sought service with the lords of this land, but have been most grieviously disappointed. Half of them ask me to entertain them by writing tanka or playing biwa, as though I were an entertainer. They do not recognize the nobility of the kuge of the emperor's court! I have looked for you, to see if you would wish me to join you again."),
  ("npc10_rehire_speech", "Captain! It's good to see you. You see, it turns out I'm not much of a farmer. Too soft on the hired hands, I figure. I let them rob me blind. I guess fighting is what I know best. So tell me, captain, are you still looking for good men?"),
  ("npc11_rehire_speech", "Captain! So good to see you! People say that you've been making gold hand over foot. I'm fidgety, I'll admit. I left you because I wasn't satisfied with the warrior's life, but I spend a bit of time in town and I realize that there are worse things in life than a full belly, honest companions, and the joy of seeing the enemy run before you. So, would you be hiring again?"),
  ("npc12_rehire_speech", "Captain! It's a fine thing to see an honest face like yours. This world is full of lies. I went to my rebuilt monastery, to be with my brohers. They have become a band of sohei warrior monks, and that excited me because of my experience in your company. But it turns out they have become nothing more than brigands during their time away from each other. And the new recruits and laybrothers are nothing but outlaws looking for temporary sanctuary from justice, not redemption for past sins. I would progress in my enlightenment by being with you. Are you looking for a surgeon?"),
  ("npc13_rehire_speech", "Well hello there, oh valorous one. I had been hoping to see you again. Everywhere I go, I hear poems and songs of your deeds. I will admit that I felt a twinge of regret that we had parted ways, and, I'll confess, a twinge of jealousy as well at your reputation. I thought that once again I might fight by your side, and thus bask in the reflection of your glory. Perhaps we might ride together again, for a little while?"),
  ("npc14_rehire_speech", "Captain. It is good to see you. When last we parted, I was ready to swear that I would not serve you again, but perhaps I judged you too harshly. All over Japan, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. If you would have me in your company, I would fight for you again."),
  ("npc15_rehire_speech", "Why hello, {playername}-dono. I can't say I'm entirely displeased to see you. You see, I took on another master before I left, and sure enough, when it came time to protect the honor of his loyal subordinate, the lord kicked me to the curb. I can't say I was always happy in your company, but at least you had faith in me. You still offering work?"),
  ("npc16_rehire_speech", "Captain! They say that you've done well for yourself since we last met. I'll come out and admit that I cursed your name when we parted ways, but thinking back on it you weren't all that bad. All these lords, they're glad enough to send me on little side errands, but they don't much care to have me in their main battle-line. Apparently I spook the men. I've heard it muttered that I'm cursed, or that I eat hearts after killing men, or other rot. Not that I mind stabbing a man while he's asleep, but it's a lot more gratifying when he's awake and kicking. So I thought I'd try to find you again, see if you'll take me on."),
  ("npc17_rehire_speech", "{Lord/Lady} {playername}, I was wrong. I attempted to return to Korea and only by a hair's width I am alive to be back in Japan, begging to return to your service."),
  ("npc18_rehire_speech", "Captain, I was about to set off south towards the Moluccas -- a place I had been before, but never at great length -- when I stepped back from boarding the ship. Something in me feels my time in Japan is not yet over. Will you have me back?"),
  ("npc19_rehire_speech", "{playername}! What's up! Miss me? To tell you the truth, I miss YOU. Say, how about fighting together like old times?"),
  ("npc20_rehire_speech", "Skipper, I'm cold, hungry, and I get seasick where I never had that happen to me before. I think I'm a landlubber now. How about having me back?"),
  ("npc21_rehire_speech", "After I left you, I became more hungry than ever before in my life. Will you have me at your table again?"),
  ("npc22_rehire_speech", "{Chief/Chieftess}, do you remember when we first met? We talked about setting up a new Hiraizumi. It was just a shared joke of course, but it started a fire within me. I feel like only in your service could I accomplish what I need to do... Will you have me back?"),

  ("npc1_home_intro", "Boss -- did you know that I was born around here, in the San'yodo region? This is where I got my knack with the sword, because this is good land for fighting, although a hard land for men. San'yo is also the name of the road that passes through here, from Kyoto to Kyushu. Every petty daimyo wants to control it."),
  ("npc2_home_intro", "We're approaching Edo. That's where my grandfather was headed when he disappeared."),
  ("npc3_home_intro", "Can you smell that? The stench of soybeans being fermented into soy sauce. It's the scent of Miura. This was where I washed ashore after my ship sank. The people took me in and I was more worried about the stink than my wounds."),
  ("npc4_home_intro", "The northern coast. Bah. This place is thick with bandits."),
  ("npc5_home_intro", "Captain, we are nearing Okayama, largest town in the San'yodo region. My ship landed in Nagasaki, but it was here where I first thought to seek service with a lord. After that is when I ran into you."),
  ("npc6_home_intro", "I can see by the cherry trees on the hillside that I am near home. I have no wish to see this place. I have a lifetime of memories here, but things are different now and I would not be recognized. I will linger outside the gates if you go into town. I hope you understand."),
  ("npc7_home_intro", "Do you smell that? Salt fish, rotting flax and river mud. The smells of my childhood. I want to retch."),
  ("npc8_home_intro", "Hmf. Do you hear that? It must be the bells of a Buddhist temple. We must be near Joguji monastery."),
  ("npc9_home_intro", "Behold the castle of Hiroshima! The strongest fortress in Japan. I may be a kuge of the Imperial Court in Kyoto, but I am related to the daimyo that live here."),
  ("npc10_home_intro", "D'you smell that fresh air, {brother/sister}? This was my home, before I went off in search of adventure. It's good to be up near the mountains again. It's the smell of freedom, here under Tsuyama Castle."),
  ("npc11_home_intro", "We must be getting near home."),
  ("npc12_home_intro", "We're passing by the site of one of the greatest evils, if that interests you."),
  ("npc13_home_intro", "Ah, Nagaoka! Such a lovely spot, at the foot of the mountains. Such happy days I spent here, the summer before last."),
  ("npc14_home_intro", "Do you see that fortress up there, on the spur over the valley? Shibata? I spent a winter there some years back, trying to train the lord's men."),
  ("npc15_home_intro", "You see that castle up on the hill? Odawara Castle, it's called. I worked for the lord there, not long ago. It's not as showy as some of the other castles in this land, but it's the finest stonework you ever saw."),
  ("npc16_home_intro", "Aye, we must be getting near my birthplace."),
  ("npc17_home_intro", "Ah, Hakata. This was the first place I ever set foot on in Japan."),
  ("npc18_home_intro", "Oooh, Nara."),
  ("npc19_home_intro", "Obama Castle? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha."),
  ("npc20_home_intro", "Nagasaki! It's the closest thing I have to a home."),
  ("npc21_home_intro", "The castle town of Kochi was the first populated area I came across after I jumped ship."),
  ("npc22_home_intro", "We're approaching where Hiraizumi was once located."),

  ("npc1_home_description", "Well, samurai always liked building castles here, ever since the old days, when the Emperors first gave them fiefs to keep order. When my mother was a lass, the samurai started campaigning in earnest, and now there's a daimyo in Himeji."),
  ("npc2_home_description", "People say that we samurai are a bunch of bloodthirsty murderers, but we are extremely cultured and polite, if you ask me. Poetry, calligraphy, meditation -- all are these are parts of a bushi's education as much as swordsmanship and archery. And what about the highwaymen that must have waylaid my grandfather?"),
  ("npc3_home_description", "Japan is relatively isolated from the rest of the world -- even from China, for God's sake. But the Japanese have built great industries, even in this era of civil wars. They've not been stagnant. Someday, they won't be able to hide anymore, and they'll have to deal with everyone else. But they won't be too far behind. They'll catch up. Maybe they'll even surpass the Chinese and Europeans."),
  ("npc4_home_description", "Well, you see, a local warlord once declared a quasi-war with the Chinese. We couldn't actually invade, of course, so he rounded up farmers and fishermen, armed them, and sent them away to infest the waters off Korea and northern China. So what happens when people used to a pirate's life come home? They take their work with them. And pass stories and skills to their children. They no longer get subsidized to prey on the Koreans and Chinese but there are targets all over here."),
  ("npc5_home_description", "Chinese people have always come to Japan, to trade. Until the the Ming Emperors banned it, at least. Many of us continued anyway, but it was barely a trickle compared to before."),
  ("npc6_home_description", "Here in Kyoto, our dialect and customs are closer than anywhere else in Japan to those of old Yamato. We grow rice, crops brought to this land from the mainland by the emperors, and also follow the old ways."),
  ("npc7_home_description", "Before I was went off to campaign, and before I was trained as a samurai, I lived here. I was born in a mansion but spent my childhood near the fields. We were landlords , but we never usually saw our peasants, merely our cursed minions that oversaw them. My father, fat and idle that he was, inspired their fear. They cringed before him."),
  ("npc8_home_description", "Back home in Europe, we Jesuits are considered militaristic. Brother Ignacio de Loyola was a knight -- kind of like a samurai -- in the Spanish army. He based our order on his experiences in war. But these Buddhists..."),
  ("npc9_home_description", "Our great great grandfather was a counselor of state that worked under the regent. My great grandfather was the first son, the daimyo's was the second. That's just how it goes. Although the kuge and samurai seem miles apart, we're still nobles in the end. Even samurai with common origins eventually marry into clans with more illustrious lineages. They can't change their background, but their children will still have the noble blood of their mothers."),
  ("npc10_home_description", "We have the finest cherry trees here in western Japan. Around five thousand of them. People from all over the country travel here to view them when they blossom in the spring. We had an endless chain of festivals throughout the year, too. I miss that kind of life."),
  ("npc11_home_description", "I'm from Uji. You know, the village around the biggest and most holy Shinto shrine in all of Japan? Yeah. I'm not a very moral or virtuous person despite where I came from. Even though my best friend growing up was a miko."),
  ("npc12_home_description", "The lord over there in Fukui Castle was the first to wage war against the Ikko-Ikki. Ironically, one of his sons was the devout Buddhist daimyo that prevented me from being put to death."),
  ("npc13_home_description", "I had come up here with a small merchant travelling party from Kyoto, but they were caught by bandits from the woods. I fled on horseback and found shelter up in the high valleys, in the arms of the kindest farmer you ever saw. She took me to a cave near the high pastures, and would bring me cheese and berries, and tell me the tales from the hills -- of playful goat-men who guide lost animals back to their flocks, or of ghostly huntsmen who ride the winds, chasing stormclouds. Such rustics they are!"),
  ("npc14_home_description", "I say 'trying' because in my opinion, ashigaru don't take well to discipline. Finest archers you ever saw, and good spearmen too, but they are hard to rein in after battle. Their skills serve them well in war, but they are not well-rounded as the samurai are. No poetry, no Zen Buddhism, no soul. Just fighting."),
  ("npc15_home_description", "Like most castles that last around here, it's got foundations that are from the Muromachi period. Beautiful location, too -- Odawara sits right in front of the pass leading out of the Kanto plain, which allows the lord to control the traffic through the Tokaido road."),
  ("npc16_home_description", "My family's holdings were modest, not enough to hire a force of ashigaru. That's why we had to be retainers of a higher lord. Most of our income came from that."),
  ("npc17_home_description", "I tumbled off the ship, so the first part of me that actually touched the country was probably my shoulder. The guards had thrown me off, you see."),
  ("npc18_home_description", "This was the first place I thought to visit when I arrived. It used to be the first real capital of Japan, you know?"),
  ("npc19_home_description", "Obama. Castle. Oh God. Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."),
  ("npc20_home_description", "I was born in China, of course. Fujian province, to be specific. I even spent more time there than here. But Nagasaki was where I came of age. It's where I met my husband as well. I taught him everything I knew, and then he became a pirate like me."),
  ("npc21_home_description", "I didn't really jump, per se. That implies I left alone, possibly by sneaking away with none of my crewmates the wiser. I have to be honest, it was pretty brutal. I hacked apart the first mate and took two of the officers hostage."),
  ("npc22_home_description", "It was an Emishi stronghold, but it once rivalled Kyoto in size and splendor."),

  ("npc1_home_description_2", "They don't go easy on us common folk, and ask for too much tax -- even though we can't really pay. The land isn't good enough for rice. Frankly, it's only good for fishing. In the summer a daimyo would travel east or west through the road with his army, then in winter retreat the other way. Very predictable."),
  ("npc2_home_description_2", "I don't idealize or obsess over a formal code, but I train to fight and kill and others of my social class train to fight and kill because we have a duty to keep the people safe. Someday, we will live in an era where nobody's grandfather will suddenly disappear while travelling on the road."),
  ("npc3_home_description_2", "The land of the rising sun..."),
  ("npc4_home_description_2", "How do I know this, you ask? Well... I was taken by them, and held for ransom, but I got away. That's really all there is to tell."),
  ("npc5_home_description_2", "This is how things go, I guess."),
  ("npc6_home_description_2", "I am proud to be from this province. The present-day ruler is a vassal of some would-be shogun, but as far as I am concerned he is just yet another upstart samurai, and we revere only the emperor and serve only his regent."),
  ("npc7_home_description_2", "We had people who fished the river and grew rice that we all took in as tax. They were always hungry, and weak, but never had the courage to rebel."),
  ("npc8_home_description_2", "In Europe it's not unheard of for the religious to take up arms or for people to fight over religion. We had the holy crusades against the Muslims and the pagan Balts. There were the Cathars. And now we fight the schismatic Protestants. But monks and priests themselves taking up arms and waging war? Buddhism is a violent religion."),
  ("npc9_home_description_2", "Even if I have no hope of regaining my family, I haven't lost my blood. My children, if I ever have any, might just have to settle for being samurai, like my distant cousin who rules this town."),
  ("npc10_home_description_2", "But the land here is bad for rice farming, and I was the second son. Since I wasn't going to stay home to be a farmer, I set off for Osaka after I grew up. Been moving through different big cities as a common laborer ever since. Until you, anyway."),
  ("npc11_home_description_2", "But Uji is more than just the huge shrine. We have farmers and fishermen here too, not just priests and pilgrims. They're all good folk. Except for our merchants and samurai, who are bad folk. As a thief, I'm somewhere in between."),
  ("npc12_home_description_2", "Nothing is cut and dry. You'll never know who your friends and enemies are. The daimyo that had my temple sacked didn't know we were peaceful. But now his greatest fear is true as the survivors take up arms. Many of my order evaded capture, unlike me, and now hold bitter hatred against all samurai. They will never know about the one that saved my life."),
  ("npc13_home_description_2", "Eventually I had to leave, and sometimes I'd be tempted to try to find her -- but no, no, one should never look back."),
  ("npc14_home_description_2", "If anyone were ever to unify this little land of ours, I'd have them disbanded en masse and never mobilized again. Too much trouble than they're worth. But I suppose if we didn't need them, they wouldn't have been recruited. Just like me."),
  ("npc15_home_description_2", "Here's the funny thing -- when the buke first rebelled against the kuge, they all said they weren't going to have any puppet rulers anymore. You can guess how long that lasted. The Hojo clan ended up controlling the shoguns the way the regents controlled the Emperor. It was obscene. After they were overthrown by the Ashikaga, who became the new shoguns, a Hojo descendant takes Odawara and starts off this new era of wars between the domains. Now we might be on the verge of a third shogunate. Maybe they'll actually keep power this time."),
  ("npc16_home_description_2", "It was a good living, despite it all, even with so many mouths around to feed. Still, the daimyo don't make life easy for us. We have to fight and die for him, after all. Of course, I couldn't say I wouldn't do the same to some poorer samurai family if I had a castle and army all of my own. The mighty do whatever they can, and the humble do whatever they must."),
  ("npc17_home_description_2", "The Japanese were perplexed and tried to shove me back, but the ship's men were under orders. They eventually convinced them that I was a nobleman, however, and not some troublesome convict."),
  ("npc18_home_description_2", "At least that's what the locals kept telling me! I just came to appreciate the magnificent temples."),
  ("npc19_home_description_2", "I've been here a billion times, and it'll never stop getting to me."),
  ("npc20_home_description_2", "I should feel remorseful that I led him on the path that eventually killed him, but my guilt is from the fact that I don't feel shame about it at all. He knew what he was getting into, just like I knew what I was getting into. He just happened to die, and I happened to live. Life's funny like that."),
  ("npc21_home_description_2", "I forced them to row me to Shikoku island with a blade brandished inches from their faces. Exactly what happened when we made landfall and they tried to overpower me, I shall never speak to another soul."),

  ("npc3_kingsupport_1", "Well, my {lord/lady} -- I would worry for you. Our histories tell us that power tends to corrupt. But in the end, I am comforted by the mercy and judgment you have shown as captain of this company."),
  ("npc4_kingsupport_1", "Well, captain, I think that you would be the kind of {shogun/regent} that well-born gentlemen such as myself would be proud to follow into battle..."),
  ("npc5_kingsupport_1", "A fine idea - you have shown that you know how to govern men. Mind that you govern them justly, though..."),
  ("npc6_kingsupport_1", "I cannot judge the legal merits of your claim. However, I think that unlike the other warlords here, you have the capacity to unify this land -- and that would put a stop to these endless wars, between domain and domain, clan and clan, and brother and brother, that have brought us all into disgrace in the eyes of the heavens."),
  ("npc7_kingsupport_1", "Aye -- you'll do well. You know how to treat ruffians."),
  ("npc8_kingsupport_1", "Those graced by God may claim the throne of their countries. I'd say that you could make that claim."),
  ("npc9_kingsupport_1", "Very good, my lord. I'm of the kuge, the true nobility that serves the emperor, while these daimyo only serve a shogun. So I don't owe them anything. But I would support you in establishing your own bakufu if it means bringing them all to their knees."),
  ("npc10_kingsupport_1", "Well, {brother/sister}, I suppose there must be {shoguns/regents}, and if there must be {shogun/regent}, then you would be as good a {shogun/regent} as any..."),
  ("npc11_kingsupport_1", "That's a great idea, boss. All these daimyo and samurai who rule now, with their 'tsujigiri' crossroads killings and 'kirisute gomen' summary executions for any man or woman who might for whatever reason not treat them like living gods the way they think they're entitled to -- Japan deserves something better."),
  ("npc12_kingsupport_1", "I am sure that you would make a fine shogun, {brother/sister}. I flatter myself that I am a good judge of character, and you have demonstrated a capacity for compassion that far exceeds that of these others who call themselves lords."),
  ("npc13_kingsupport_1", "That would be a fine thing, {playername}-dono! Many is the tale of the {hero/heroine} who has proven {his/her} worthiness to rule through valor. Perhaps you know of {Minamoto no Yorimoto, the first shogun of the Kamakura bakufu/Empress Jingu, who conquered Korea and ruled in her own right}. A splendid tale!"),
  ("npc14_kingsupport_1", "Well, sir, the heavens have instituted a hierarchy in this world, and normally I would have no truck with usurpation. But I also think that the daimyo of this land are a weak and sorry lot, not worthy of the name of shogun, and that leaves the right to rule free to be taken by a better {man/ruler}, such as yourself."),
  ("npc15_kingsupport_1", "Well, you pay your men on time, when you can, generally speaking. That's the best qualification for the bakufu there is, in my book. You honor your men as they honor you."),
  ("npc16_kingsupport_1", "Why not, captain? I'm sure you'd make a fine shogun -- and of course I'd hope you remember the little people like myself who did you a pretty turn on your scramble to the throne."),

  ("npc2_kingsupport_2", "Most of the lords of this land are base opportunists who care more about power than honor. They're ultimately more like merchants than warriors. You, on the other hand, have real experience. You know how to take a life with a swing of a sword from the front rather than lead a rabble from the back. You would institute a true shogunate -- a rule of warriors for warriors. If you like, my {lord/lady}, I could find some support for you among the samurai of this domain."),
  ("npc3_kingsupport_2", "I would, {my lord/my lady}. But I would strongly recommend that you open Japan for trade and immigration. It would be good for the country to catch up with the rest of the world now rather than later in the sciences, and to share with everyone else your cultural achievements. It would be for your own good, {sir/my lady}."),
  ("npc4_kingsupport_2", "Of course, {captain/my lady}. The trick is now to get others to follow you. As you know, one's lineage is a great determinant of one's worthiness. Perhaps you have a long-lost ancestor of whom you have not told me?"),
  ("npc5_kingsupport_2", "Ay, I would. But there is something I should say, on behalf of the fellow civilized women such as myself. It would bring great joy to me, to hear from the lips of one who would be shogun, that you would help restore an ancient right."),
  ("npc6_kingsupport_2", "I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become shogun, there would be one law and one peace -- from Kamakura to Kyoto, from Ezo to Kyushu."),
  ("npc7_kingsupport_2", "Yes, captain, I would. A shogun's duty is to keep {his/her} followers employed. To fully use their talents. Rule through your samurai, not your daimyos. We are wariors, not bean-counters like them."),
  ("npc8_kingsupport_2", "I would -- on one condition. You'd accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior. Nothing more, nothing less."),
  ("npc9_kingsupport_2", "I would, {sir/madam}, and others would too. But here's what I think -- you need to show the kuge that you'll restore the ancient ways. Right now, Japan's a mess -- the petty daimyo own the land and fight each other, in order to bring about a new shogun that will rule us all. But look where it always leads -- remember the the Genpei and Genko wars? Similar to our era, wouldn't you say? This will keep happening over and over until the emperor is restored to his rightful place."),
  ("npc10_kingsupport_2", "Certainly, {brother/sister}. But I'd ask that you consider a thought of mine. If you became {shogun/regent}, then I'd ask you open your court to the people, and not just to the samurai. I'd ask you to let it be known that should any man be judged and sentenced, that he have the right to appeal to you directly. Right now, nobody has that right, not even samurai -- I say every man in Japan should have it."),
  ("npc11_kingsupport_2", "Sure would, boss. But let me tell you what might bring others to your cause -- take away the samurai's right to kill commoners at their whim. Sure they say it's only for when their so-called 'honor' is at stake, but they use it for all kinds of shameful reasons, like if a peasant doesn't bow low enough when they pass, or if they want to test out the sharpness of their new sword."),
  ("npc12_kingsupport_2", "Of course, {brother/sister}. But if I have learned anything in my travels in this land, it is that the Japanese are sticklers for tradition. Everything must be done as it was done in the days of old -- even though not more than one in a hundred of them can read or speak the formal langauge of the Imperial Court!"),
  ("npc13_kingsupport_2", "Of course, {playername}-dono. Also, as we learn from many tales, when claiming power, it does not hurt to be the subject of an epic, recited around campfires and hearthfires, describing one's deeds. As you no doubt know, I fancy myself a fair crafter of couplets."),
  ("npc14_kingsupport_2", "I would indeed, {sir/my lady}. I think you can unite this land, and then we'll be able to raise an army such as Japan has not seen for many generations -- samurai, ashigaru, sohei monks, yamabushi -- and take it over the mountains to subdue all the lands that the emperors once held sway."),
  ("npc15_kingsupport_2", "I would. People might say that you don't have imperial blood in your veins. But as far as I've seen, imperial blood makes you soft. Daimyo and kuge are self-obsessed and disrespectful. Almost as base as merchants and craftsmen. If you ask me, honor makes a {man/woman} a ruler, not a fancy pedigree."),
  ("npc16_kingsupport_2", "Of course, my {lord/lady}. And what's more, I figure a man like me could do you a bit of a service raising support with the lords of this land. I may have only had a small part in their schemes and intrigues over the years, but I think I know what they want. And given what I know of their secrets, they'd not want to be denying me admission to their halls, now would they?"),
  ("npc17_kingsupport_2", "I already said I would, didn't I? But I ask a favor -- once Japan is in your hands, I would be forever grateful if you would raise an army to free my homeland from its puppet king. I'm sure your soldiers would be greeted as liberators."),
  ("npc18_kingsupport_2", "Of course! But I would like you to issue edicts to the effect that men and women are to be treated equally. If I had been born a man, I would not have had to run from my father's household, never to return -- my journey would have been sanctioned."),
  ("npc19_kingsupport_2", "Yeah, sure, you're great! But uh, I'm not sure about how things are turning out... It was supposed to be... well... I don't know. I don't really know anything about Japanese history. I just know it wasn't supposed to... well... hrm..."),
  ("npc20_kingsupport_2", "You better believe it! But you gotta dream big. There's more to unifying the land than through conquest. You have to redirect the people's energies to a single purpose to legitimize your rule. Like, say, a colonizing expedition to the Americas!"),
  ("npc21_kingsupport_2", "I meant what I said -- you're the best hope Japan has. But you might also be the best hope my homeland has... You see, we're a few dozen bickering islands with nothing keeping us together. If you sent an expedition to unify us, maybe we could resist the Spanish."),
  ("npc22_kingsupport_2", "You certainly do. But I ask one thing. Once you have Japan in your pocket, I would like you to guarantee the continued independence of my people and pledge to rein in your adventurous samurai."),

What do you say to that , my {lord/lady}?"),

I shall go about the Kinai and tell the nobles that when you are shogun, you will strive your hardest to protect the weak and to crush discord, so that no man will raise his hand against another with impunity, and one day, perhaps, my husband's fate would be extraordinary rather than commonplace."),
  ("npc7_kingsupport_3", "I'll tell you what, {playername}-dono. Give me a few weeks and I'll go to some of these villages, with their manors full of idle samurai. I'll tell them that once you unify this land, you'll make them your administrators. You'll put them to good use keeping the country in line, at peace. We'll help you bring Japan through a new age of prosperity through wise and honorable government, -- not through the machinations of the daimyo or base commerce of the merchants."),

  ("npc12_kingsupport_3", "But you know what? There is no 'imperial' tradition when it came to the shogun. It makes sense that power should go to the one most fit to govern -- which would be you, naturally.

You can't institute a government of a crass ex-soldiers and expect them to keep in line, you'll find to your dismay."),

I hear that Youmu's gone off to sing a pretty song to the samurai, on how you'll hand them Japan on a silver platter for them to impose their stultifying way of life. I hope that's just a tale you're telling. A true noble lord exercises his -own- power of life and death over people. That's my expectation, anyway."),

They're fishermen --- I've even helped out on the boat from time to time -- and so they get to pick up a bit of the gossip round the ports and great halls of the {s18}. I could go over there for a few days and tell you what I find out."),

He is a good man, the kind who speaks little and listens much. I'm sure over a drink or two he might let us know which way the political winds are blowing in those parts."),
  ("npc5_intel_mission", "If you like, {playername}, I can take a few days to visit the Chinese quarter in {s17}, and hear the news from all across the {s18}. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivaries of the great lords, if that is of interest to you."),
  ("npc6_intel_mission", "Captain -- while I am not strictly welcome in {s17}, I would be able to make contact with some Buddhist nuns at a nearby temple. They are well-placed in court society, and also less inclined than most to find me strange. If you give me a few days, I may be able to collect some interesting information about the {s18}."),
  ("npc7_intel_mission", "Captain. When I left my former home in {s17}, I had promised myself that I would never return until I retired from a warrior's life. Perhaps I was rash. I am occasionally curious as to how my family is getting along. Perhaps I can bring them some gifts, to let them know what I have made of myself! Any rate, they may have useful information about the {s18}, if you would give me a few days to pay them a visit."),
  ("npc8_intel_mission", "If you have any interest in the events in the {s18}, a convert of mine keeps a farm near {s17}. He keeps in contact with a number of others in the Christian community. I could visit him for a few days, and learn more about what is going on there."),
  ("npc9_intel_mission", "{Sir/My lady} -- it has been some time since I sampled the delights of {s17}, where those such as myself are wont to partake of the hospitality of the most generous lord. If you wish, I could perhaps go there, and let you know something about the concerns that weigh on the minds of the generals of the {s18}."),
  ("npc10_intel_mission", "Captain -- I was thinking that some of my old friends in {s17} would be glad to see me. They are good men, and like me they have no particular affection for the samurai that dominate them. They are probably willing to slip a little political gossip our way. The bushi are always falling out over one little thing or the other, but the men might be able to know if there's real dissent brewing."),
  ("npc11_intel_mission", "{playername}{-kun/-oneechan} -- I was thinking that it's been a while since I visited my folks in {s17}. They've been kind enough to me over the years, helping me out during the lean times, so I feel I'd like to share some of my newfound fortune with them. I've also donated enough times to the shrine for them to like me. I'd reckon they might be persuaded to spill a few tidbits about events in the {s18}, if that would interest you."),
  ("npc12_intel_mission", "If you wish, Captain, I would not mind taking the time to pay a visit to a pupil of mine, now employed by the lord of {s17}. I had great hopes for him, but he became an advisor for a daimyo. This is a betrayal of our order, and I must journey there swiftly to correct him. While I am there, if you wish, I could question him on the latest trends within the {s18}, a matter which may interest you."),
  ("npc13_intel_mission", "Oh valiant one! With your permission, I was thinking that I might pay a visit to the orchards near {s17}. I try not to revisit old pastures, but I must confess a certain curiosity as to how a handsome nobleman of my former acquaintance is getting along. On the way, I may attempt to stop in at the castle. I suspect that it would not be terribly difficult for me to charm my way into the court, and I may be able to provide you with the latest news from the {s18}."),
  ("npc14_intel_mission", "Captain... As you may know, I helped train the garrison of {s17}. One of their number has lately been in touch with me, and suggests that if I were to visit him, he could pass me information on events within the {s18}. I am willing to do this, if you can spare me. While it is a great disgrace to be a traitor, there is no dishonor in making use of one."),
  ("npc15_intel_mission", "Captain. As you may know, I have for some time harbored a wish to go to {s17}, and study swordsmanship at a school there -- it's one of the finest examples of the old style of tachi and tanto. As it happens, one of my colleagues is currently engaged there doing training. While his sense of honor I think would prevent him, rightfully, from disclosing to me any techniques, I suspect that he would not be averse to offering up his opinion on the general state of the {s18}, if that is of interest to you."),
  ("npc16_intel_mission", "Oy, Captain! I had a mind to pay a visit to my old haunts at {s17}. I could have a wee chat with my old friend the castellan, who'll be letting me into the place, about goings-on in the {s18}."),
  ("npc17_intel_mission", "The {s18} really welcomed me with the honor and respect I deserved, when times were especially tough. I could pay the castellan at {s17} a visit and ask about his clan's state of affairs. He probably wouldn't mind, as long as he doesn't know it's for you."),
  ("npc18_intel_mission", "If you would like, Captain, I could go back to {s17}, where I first arrived in Japan, to gather information about the {s18} from the few contacts I made there."),
  ("npc19_intel_mission", "I made other friends than you, {playername}, if you want me to ask them about what's going on where they live. Like say, {s17}, under the {s18}."),
  ("npc20_intel_mission", "If you like, {playername}, I can take a few days to visit the Chinese quarter in {s17}, and hear the news from all across the {s18}. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivaries of the great lords, if that is of interest to you."),
  ("npc21_intel_mission", "Captain, my landfall after I ran away from my ship was not the first time I ever came to Japan. I know some ships that call at {s17}, I could journey there for a few days and gather information from them about the {s18}."),
  ("npc22_intel_mission", "Captain. When I left Ezo on my first journey to Kyoto, I stopped by {s17}. It turned into an extended stay, which annoyed me to no end, but I did at least make a few contacts. Perhaps I could return and make use of them, to gather information about the {s18}. If you would give me a few days, I would pay them a visit."),

  ("npc1_fief_acceptance", "You'd grant lowly Kojiro daimyo status? Well, I'd be daft to turn you down, now wouldn't I? My, the strange turns that life takes... Fancy this commoner becoming a great mover and shaker in Japan."),

  ("npc3_fief_acceptance", "{My lord/My lady}, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}. I would be pleased to hold it, and dedicate myself to the moral and material uplift of its inhabitants."),
  ("npc4_fief_acceptance", "It is good of you to grant me {s17} as a fief -- and most appropriate. Proud indeed is the daimyo who has a shisho of the Shinto Muso-ryo as {his/her} vassal."),
  ("npc5_fief_acceptance", "{playername}-dono -- I would be most pleased to hold {s17}. I will send word home, to my kinsmen, and let them know that there is honor to be earned serving under me in your armies -- and they will come flocking to fight for you!"),
  ("npc6_fief_acceptance", "{Sir/Lady} -- I am surprised that you find me worthy to govern men, as I am just beginning to learn to govern my own self. But if you indeed wish it, I would be most honored to hold {s17} in your name, and dedicate myself to the protection of those who live there."),
  ("npc7_fief_acceptance", "Aye, I'll hold {s17} -- and give it a reputation that strikes fear in the hearts of thieves and brigands across Japan. Thank you, {playername}-dono, for this opportunity."),
  ("npc8_fief_acceptance", "You'd make me a daimyo? Well, I suppose that I can postpone my mission for a little while longer, and make a cathedral at {s17}. Some day, I may travel over the seas to continue my task, but until then, I would be pleased to shepherd the christian community of my holding and have them fight under your banner for the glory of christendom."),
  ("npc9_fief_acceptance", "{My lord/My lady}, I was cheated of my inheritance -- but now, with this offer of this estate, you make right what was wrong. It would give me the greatest honor to serve you, to fight for you, and to hold this land in fief to you."),
  ("npc10_fief_acceptance", "You'd make me a daimyo? Well, no thank you -- but if you would call me 'governor' -- a servant of the people and not of a warlord -- then I suppose I could bring myself to run {s17} for you. I'd put food in the bellies of the hungry, and raise a fine force of ashigaru to fight on your behalf, {brother/sister}. But I can't promise that the real bushi will enjoy rubbing shoulders with me in your councils."),
  ("npc11_fief_acceptance", "You'd make me lady of {s17}, Boss? Well, that would be the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for me in a long time. Heh. I'll make the most of it -- you can count on that. I have to say, though -- I'm not sure how the other lords of this realm will react, when they find Marisa in their august company."),
  ("npc12_fief_acceptance", "Well, {brother/sister}, I'd have you know that don't believe in the holding of domain in fief to the shogun. Farmers and landholders should govern their own affairs, under the distant watch of the bakufu. That being said, Japan has seen far too much bloodshed for us to turn the social order on its head right now. Give me that land, and I'll endeavor to prepare it for a brighter future -- if not in this generation, than perhaps in the next."),
  ("npc13_fief_acceptance", "How generous and kind of you, {playername}-dono. Allow me to express the utmost reverence for your wisdom in selecting me. Truly, your perspicacity exceeds that of Emperor Kemmu, who could read the character of a man from a single hair of his head. Your judgment surpasses that of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, to whom even the yamabushi submitted their disputes. Anyway, I accept."),
  ("npc14_fief_acceptance", "You do me a great honor, captain. A youngest son such as myself has few opportunities to earn a fief of his own. But here, with you, there is still the chance for a man to win with his sword what was denied him by his birth! I shall hold {s17} as your vassal, and raise an army to fight for your glory and for mine."),
  ("npc15_fief_acceptance", "Well, {my lord/my lady}, that's a gracious act, and marks you as the kind of ruler who can save this sorry land from the incompetence of the current batch. I suspect a lot of the daimyo around here will think that a ronin like me isn't fit to hold a domain. Well, when they see what I do with it, and what armies I can raise, they'll change their tune!"),
  ("npc16_fief_acceptance", "Oh, that's most generous of you, {my lord/my lady}. I've been in and out of many a great hall -- not always with the master's permission, I should add -- but I never thought I'd own one myself. Let me think... When I collect my first year's rents, what weapons shall I commission myself?"),
  ("npc17_fief_acceptance", "A fief in Japan? I am honored. I will surely hold {s17} in trust for you. But I will go back to Korea someday, and I'm not sure if I can keep it. Maybe I'll have a half-Japanese son to leave it to by then."),
  ("npc18_fief_acceptance", "A ruler in my own right? Oh my... I never expected my journey to end this way... But it doesn't even feel wrong at all. Yes, {playername}-dono -- I suppose that's how I should address you as a daimyo now -- I'll take {s17} as my fief."),
  ("npc19_fief_acceptance", "Thank you, {playername}, you are a true friend. No offense to the others, but I think I am a good choice for {s17}. I am centuries ahead of them with regards to management practice and theory. Figurative centuries, of course..."),
  ("npc20_fief_acceptance", "Lady of {s17}? Haha, I knew you were the right one to hitch my fortunes to! Thank you, Captain {playername}."),
  ("npc21_fief_acceptance", "As lord of {s17}, I could eat all the... meat... I ever wanted... I'm immune from prosecution as a daimyo, right?"),

You are well deserving of a fief of your own -- and I suspect that if you were not a woman, a daimyo would have offered you one by now. That is the way of the men in this sorry land: they let us stand in the front of the battleline to take the enemy's blows, but when it comes to a division of the spoils, they expect us to head to the rear."),
  ("npc6_woman_to_woman", "Excuse me, {playername}. I would like to offer you my congratulations -- it seems that you are well on your way to making a name for yourself as a warrior to be feared. If you were a man, I suspect the daimyo of Japan would be falling over themselves to make you their vassal.

I suspect that if you were a man, a daimyo would have offered you a fief by now. But we ladies should come to expect things like that. Men will find any excuse not to reward us for our work, so if we take a fancy to a bit of land somewhere, maybe we should just reach out and take it. That's the way I look at the world, anyway."),

  ("npc5_turn_against", "{playername}-dono! I took your salt, and was well rewarded for it! However, I will remind you-- that while I may be an ardent follower, and a devoted friend, I will never be your slave... Anyway, today I come against you with my sword raised. But I hope that one day we raise a glass together, to a friendship renewed."),

I had never served you as a man, but served the principles which I believed you upheld. As you no longer uphold them, I must do my best to thwart you. But I bear you no ill will, and I hope that we can meet again some day as friends"),

One small word of warning if we end up fighting each other -- once the rage of battle hits me, I can't always account for my actions. Just know that whatever I do, it's not personal. Maybe if we both walk away from this, we can meet once more as friends?"),

  ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_intro",   "I am Reisho-in, daughter of the last Imagawa lord of Suruga, and his rightful heir."),

  
  
  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "I was the only child of my father, Uesugi Norimasa, who was of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan. Although I am a woman, he loved me like a son and named me his heir -- not once, but several times, before his councillors, vassals, and samurai of the land so that none could doubt his intention. There is no law that bars a woman from ruling -- indeed, we tell tales of warrior empresses who ruled us in our distant past."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "My family had always been the dominant clan of the far north, not the upstart Date."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "I was swindled out of my birthright by my father's upstart brother-in-law. You've probably met him--he now goes by 'Great Lord Oda'. What nonsense -- they were never more than vice-shugo of Owari province. He took Inubayama right under my nose and renamed it Gifu before I could even finish consolidating the rule of my clan."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1",     "The Mori clan had served my family as right-hand men for generations. We raised them from the dirt, and they repaid us with treachery."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "You heard right, I'm rebelling against my father. He did the same thing to his own father. In fact, part of the reason I'm doing this is to avenge my grandfather's honor."),
 ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "The heads of the Imagawa clan are the rightful shugo of Suruga province, from our family castle in Sunpu. Not the upstart, so-called 'Tokugawa'. What nerve--changing their name from Matsudaira in order to claim descent from the Genji! After we were beaten by the Oda clan at Okehazama, the treacherous Matsudaira picked up the pieces."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet before my father died, during his time of greatest need, his traitorous vassal Nagao Kagetora forced him to name him his heir and adopt him as a price for his assistance -- assistance that should have been due automatically because he was a mere vassal!."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "After my father was murdered, the present Lord Date incited strife among our hereditary vassals by supporting a rival claimant as heir. The infighting weakened us and he picked up the pieces. As I think about it more and more during my exile, I am now convinced that Lord Date had my father assassinated in the first place. That is no way for a samurai to act -- a shameful display."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "I was still taking stock of my province while Oda turned my vassals. He even sent me messages of friendship through his wife, my aunt. By the time I caught wind of what was happening, it was too late. There was barely even a battle -- my army was not yet close to ready before I was thrown out of my own castle, my childhood home."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father was stabbed in the back while I was a monk in a temple. As the last of my brothers alive, I hurried home to rally his armies, but my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's other vassels, Lord Kikkawa, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died. Lord Mori then summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed ruler, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "My father is a treacherous man that will surely lead the Takeda to ruin. After Okehazama, he invaded Suruga and destroyed what remained of the Imagawa -- my wife's family! They were allies in their time of greatest need, and my father destroyed them just like that."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2", "When the last Imagawa lord died, it seemed only natural to the vassals of my family to give up and dissolve the clan, so they could pick up the pieces and run off to our Oda, Takeda, and Hojo enemies."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Kagetora and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the hereditary vassals that switched over were bribed. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal samurai, who would honor their old lord's memory and true will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will take Echigo and the Kanto by force to prove my military worth."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Until I have my rights restored in the sight of the Date clan, I will bear my shame in exile until I retake my birthright by force."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "Great Lord Oda thinks that samurai only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of the people--we admire a resolute leader, but even more a just one. We know that a man who does not respect his own family's honor will not respect the honor of his followers."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am no longer chanting sutras, but practicing the ways of the sword and bow. If Lord Mori doubts my resolve to restore my birthright, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over our blades."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Many of the hereditary vassals and I agreed that he was too deep under the influence of the Shinano retainers. He even split the inheritance of his domain for the sake of my little brother, a grandson of Suwa Yorishige. In the name of the Kai samurai, I had to overthrow him. But I failed the first time, and now I'm here."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3", "Alas, only my household servants stayed loyal to the end. But that was all I needed. I possess nothing that they could not carry out of Sunpu castle themselves, but I do own my name, my honor, and my determination. We will soon see if that is enough."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "The princess thinks she should be the head of the Uesugi? Well, her father had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted lord who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. And that's what Norimasa was -- He came running to me after his debacle at Kawagoe castle. I can't in good conscience serve a lord that could lose so soundly when he outnumbered the enemy 10 to 1."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Ashina to come to me in peace, I would honor him, and he would become the greatest of my vassals. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge my power, then sever his head from his neck so that he cannot recant."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My nephew Saito has perhaps told you of his insistence upon returning to Gifu, as though it would not be a thorn in my backside -- an unbearable salient in the heart of my territories. Let me tell you something. Ever since warlords established themselves in Japan at the expense of the capital, this land has been divided. I intend to bring every province under my banner and reintroduce peace and stability, like the Kamakura and Ashikaga shoguns before me."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "The last Ouchi? There's no such person -- they all died in battle, I'm sure of it. If they sent a son away to live in a temple, he must not have been worth much at all. They probably kicked him out of the clan -- what a pity. I don't know if one such as that can claim to be an heir if he didn't even show up to the clan's hour of greatest need!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt my son told you that I'm a backstabber and maybe even a usurper. Well, let me tell you something -- I have decades of experience as a warrior, a general, and ruler. There's more to rulership than chauvinism over your birth province. I had to make my fourth son the heir of a significant portion of my conquered lands to keep its inhabitants pacified. And for that, my headstrong first son rebelled."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "The Imagawa vassals knew what side their bread was buttered on. If they hadn't surrendered to me, they would have been living desperate, hardscrabble lives. It's better this way, even if their family has been dispossessed. Her cousin -- the real heir to Imagawa -- is the master of tea ceremonies at my castle, you know?"),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "I did her father a favor by having myself adopted. If he had died and left everything to her, there would no longer be an Uesugi family."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "The Ashina clan may have dominated the Date for centuries, but we live in an age of war and upheaval. I am sorry that he felt that he should coast on the accomplishments of his ancestors, rather than make a name for himself as other sengoku daimyo have. It is not just heritage that makes one great -- I am lord by support of my vassals, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than ancestry, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Saito would call me an upstart -- a mere vice-shugo of Owari. Does he forget where HE comes from? His grandfather -- who named me his heir, by the way -- was a Kyoto oil merchant that outsmarted everyone around him. I was that old snake's protoge the Saito's own father wasn't -- hence why I was named his heir. I can tell you this much about Saito -- he would make a fine court nobleman."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever I may or may not have done to secure my domain does not matter. I have it, and that is final. If rulership was based on family descent instead of merit, there would be chaos and incompetence rife at every level. Why do you think these wars are happening? Once the mighty have sorted things out -- whether from among the masters or the servants, it doesn't matter -- the land will be at peace again."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "If the little brat can take me down, then he deserves to have the lordship and I will watch him rule proudly, from heaven. But if he can't, I will not regret killing him."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "I don't care that she's running around talking about her family glory. What can she do without an army? But in the impossible chance that her words turn into action, I won't go easy on her just because she's a woman."),

Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Tihr with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the silk  market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cutthroat competition with the colluding Rhodok merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Veluca, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods - and worries."),

Under her direction, the band of ruffians quickly expanded their operations across the southlands. Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Japan to sustain her war band."),

After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Uxkhal and fought against the Vaegirs before leading a group of outriders that defeated a Khergit raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Japan never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries."),

Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Japan, Konrad chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Japan domains, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse."),

However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Japan was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band."),

Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed."),

Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude.

Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Japan quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman - certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory."),

In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and rasied in the slums of Reyvadin, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances.

At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Sultan's army. Just before her twentieth brithday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left.

Being bought out by another competeting trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living. Despite his pathetic fighting skills, he soon found an employment on one of the more dangerous routes through Japan.
